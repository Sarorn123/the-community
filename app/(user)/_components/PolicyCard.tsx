                A significant rule often enforced in developer communities is
                the prohibition of discussing politics. This rule is in place to
                maintain a focused and harmonious environment centered around
                coding-related topics. By avoiding political discussions, the
                community can steer clear of potential conflicts, divisiveness,
                and distractions that can arise from differing viewpoints on
                political matters. Instead, the emphasis is placed on knowledge
                sharing.
